## How to use

Start by importing all the modules youâ€™ll need for your project. The
`cuapi_wrapper` package is broken down into seperate modules for working
with companies, tasks, opportunities, users, etc.

start by importing the **copper_crm.companies** module. We can then
search these companies for those who are in California:

``` python

import cu_api.companies as companies

companies.set_headers(os.environ['MY_COPPER_KEY'],'myemail@email.com')

SunnyStates = companies.Query
SunnyStates['state'] = ['CA','FL','AZ','TX']
SunnyStates['Amenities'] = ['Pool','Beach','Hot tub']
SunnyStates.outputs = ['Account Manager','Lifetime Spend']

companies.search(SunnyStates)
```
